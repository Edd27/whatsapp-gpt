     - `/test`: This directory is for your unit and integration tests using a testing framework.
2. **Package.json:**
   - Includes a well-defined package.json file that lists dependencies and scripts for common development and production tasks.
3. **ESLint and Prettier configuration:**
   - ESLint and Prettier are pre-configured to help maintain code quality and consistency.
